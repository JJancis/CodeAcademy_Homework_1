      <strong>Death</strong> is a theme that looms large in the poetry of

        >Emily Dickinson
      </a>
      <i>(1830-86)</i>, and perhaps no more so than in the celebrated poem of
      hers that begins <em>‘I heard a Fly buzz – when I died’</em>.
      <br />
      This is not just a poem about death:
      <ins>it’s a poem about the event of death, the moment of dying</ins>.

      <p class="content">
        In summary, <i>‘I heard a Fly buzz – when I died’</i> is a poem spoken
        by a <b>dead person</b>:note the past tense of ‘died’ in that first
        line. The speaker is already dead, and is telling us about what happened
        at her deathbed. (We say ‘her’ but the speaker could well be male –
        Dickinson often adopts a male voice in her poems, so the point remains
        moot.)
        <br />
        <br />
        And dying, one of the most momentous events in anyone’s life (and
        certainly the last), is foregrounded in that opening line – though not
        as much as it could be. No, first we have to heard about the fly that
        buzzed.
        <br />
        <br />
        The opening line, <i>‘I heard a Fly buzz – when I died’</i>, is the
        opposite of bathos (that anti-climax where one starts grandly and then
        fizzles out, such as in Alexander Pope’s celebrated line from
        <a
          href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44906/the-rape-of-the-lock-canto-1"
          target="_blank"
          >The Rape of the Lock
        </a>
        : ‘Dost sometimes counsel take, and sometimes tea’): here, we start with
        the small – the literally small – and end with the momentous, ‘died’.
        <br />
        <br />
        Everything, we are told, was still and silent around the speaker’s
        deathbed. Even the mourners attending her have stopped weeping: ‘The
        Eyes around – had wrung them dry’, meaning ‘their eyes had wrung
        themselves dry’ or ‘they had wrung their eyes dry’ with crying. Now’s
        not the time for tears: only stillness and silence. Everyone,
        Dickinson’s speaker tells us, seemed braced for the moment when the
        speaker of the poem would die, and the <em>‘King’</em> would be Emily
        Dickinson<i>‘witnessed’ </i>in the room – presumably <b>King Death</b>,
        coming to take the speaker away.
        <br />
        <br />
        The speaker had just signed her will doling out her
        <i>‘Keepsakes’</i> to her beneficiaries, and it was then, we are told,
        after her last will and testament had been signed, that the fly
        <i>‘interposed’</i> itself in the scene.
        <em>‘With Blue – uncertain – stumbling Buzz’</em> uses Dickinson’s
        trademark dashes to great effect, conveying the sudden, darting way
        flies can move around a room, especially around light.
        <br />
        <br />
        We may not have thought of such a movement as
        <i> ‘stumbling’ (can flying insects stumble?)</i> and so the presence of
        the word pulls us up short, makes us stumble over Dickinson’s line.

      <p class="content">
        Perhaps no other poet has attained such a high reputation after their
        death that was unknown to them during their lifetime. Born in 1830,
        Emily Dickinson lived her whole life within the few miles around her
        hometown of <i>Amherst, Massachusetts</i>. She never married, despite
        several romantic correspondences, and was better-known as a gardener
        than as a poet while she was alive.
        <br />
        <br />
        Nevertheless, it’s not quite true that none of Dickinson’s poems was
        published during her own lifetime. A handful – fewer than a dozen of
        some 1,800 poems she wrote in total – appeared in an 1864 anthology,
        Drum Beat, published to raise money for Union soldiers fighting in the
        Civil War. But it was four years after her death, in 1890, that a book
        of her poetry would appear before the American public for the first time
        and her posthumous career would begin to take off.
        <br />
        <br />
        Dickinson collected around eight hundred of her poems into little
        manuscript books which she lovingly put together without telling anyone.
        Her poetry is instantly recognisable for her idiosyncratic use of dashes
        in place of other forms of punctuation. She frequently
        <strong>uses the four-line stanza</strong>, and, unusually for a
        nineteenth-century poet, utilises pararhyme or half-rhyme as often as
        full rhyme. The epitaph on Emily Dickinson’s gravestone, composed by the
        poet herself, features just two words: <b>‘called back’</b>.
