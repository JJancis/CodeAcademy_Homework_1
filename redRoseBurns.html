      <i>‘O my Luve is like a red, red rose’</i> is one of the
      <b>most famous</b> similes in all of poetry, one of the
      <strong>most recognisable</strong> opening lines, and one of the
      <b>best-known romantic </b>lines.
      <br />
      <br />
      Yet its true origins are a little less straightforward than we might think
      <em>(did Robert Burns even write it?)</em>, so it’s worth subjecting
      <b><i>‘A Red, Red Rose’ </i></b> to some closer scrutiny and analysis.

      As <i>Salvador Dali</i> said, the first person to compare the
      <b>cheeks</b> of a beautiful woman to a rose was obviously a poet; the
      first to repeat it was possibly an idiot.
      <br />
      And many people – poets and idiots, or both – have repeated the idea of a
      beautiful beloved being as fresh and pretty as a
      <i><strong>‘red, red rose’</strong></i
      >.
      <br />
      <br />
      And let’s be honest: the emphasis in
      <em>‘My love’s like a red, red rose’</em> is on the poet’s beloved being
      beautiful, <i>‘bonnie’</i>, <i>‘fair’</i>, and so on. We learn nothing
      else about her: she exists purely as an object of beauty who inspires
      great love and devotion in the poet.

      <strong><em>But who is :‘the poet’ here? Robert Burns?</em></strong>
    </h3>
    <p class="content">
      Well, this is where things get interesting.
      <i>‘My Love’s Like a Red, Red Rose’</i> is one of the most widely
      anthologised love poems in English, but Robert Burns may have been writing
      down <i>(and adapting)</i> an <b>existing folk song</b> by that prolific
      author, <i>‘Anon’</i>.
      <br />
      <br />
      Like another of Burns’s most famous poems,
      <a
        href="https://interestingliterature.com/2018/11/a-short-analysis-of-robert-burns-auld-lang-syne/"
        target="_blank"
      >
        <i>‘Auld Lang Syne’</i></a
      >, <i>‘A Red, Red Rose’</i> may not have been written by Robert Burns:
      <ins>only written <i>down</i> by him</ins>.
      <br />
      <br />
      Certainly, the poem reads like a song: <ins>it’s a lyric</ins>, through
      and through, with the abcb rhyme scheme and the tetrameter and trimeter
      metre recalling the traditional ballads
      <i>(associated, fittingly enough, with the Scottish Borders)</i>. And
      <em>‘A Red, Red Rose’</em> has had an impact on modern popular music: Bob
      Dylan called it his single biggest inspiration. And did the final two
      lines inspire The Proclaimers to write <i> ‘I’m Gonna Be (500 Miles)’</i>?
      One cannot choose but wonder.
